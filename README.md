## NirapodPoth – A Web-Based Road Safety and Incident Reporting System for Women 
##  Introduction 
NirapodPoth is a **database-driven web application** developed to enhance safety for 
women who frequently travel for work, education, or personal reasons.   
The system enables users to report unsafe incidents such as harassment, stalking, or 
suspicious activity in **specific, predefined locations** stored in a structured database. 
Unlike other solutions that rely on third-party map services, NirapodPoth operates entirely 
through location data stored in its own **relational database**.   
This ensures **full control over data structure, integrity, and validation**. 
The system also empowers users with features like **anonymous reporting** and **personal 
data editing**, while allowing admins to moderate and flag misleading or inappropriate 
content.   
The project reflects **real-world concerns**, with a strong emphasis on **user privacy, 
responsible reporting, and community awareness**. 

## Objectives 
- Provide a **secure platform** for women to report safety-related incidents anonymously or 
with verified identity. - Store and manage all data through a **well-structured relational database**. - Enable incident tracking based on **predefined geographic zones**. - Provide administrators tools to **manage, monitor, and flag reports** as necessary. 

## Reporting Protocols 
To ensure **report authenticity** and protect system integrity, the following rules must be 
followed before submitting a report: 
1. Users must provide their **NID number** (for internal verification only; never displayed 
publicly). 
2. Users must **select a valid location** from the system’s dropdown list of predefined areas. 
3. The **incident description** must be clear and contain **at least 15 characters**. 
4. **Duplicate reports** of the same incident by the same user are discouraged. 
5. **Abusive, irrelevant, or misleading language** is not permitted. 
6. **Personal attacks** or naming individuals directly is strictly prohibited. 
7. **Anonymous submissions** must not contain identifying personal details in the 
description. 
8. Any report violating these protocols **may be flagged as fake** by an admin and removed 
from public view.

## Key Features - 
- **User Registration** with name, email, password, and NID for identity verification.
- **Secure Login System** for reporting and dashboard access. 
- **Incident Reporting Form** with type, location, description, and incident time. 
- **Protocol Enforcement** to maintain report quality and authenticity.
- **Anonymous Reporting** option to hide user identity from others.
- **Separate Incident Time Field** (different from submission time).
- **User Dashboard** to view and edit previous reports.
- **Post-Report Safety Check**: “Are you safe now?” for emotional feedback.
- **Admin Dashboard** to view, approve, or flag reports.
- **Risky Location Highlight** based on the number of submitted reports.
- **Fake Report Flagging** by admin for protocol violations

##  DBMS Concepts Applied 
| Concept              | Implementation | 
|----------------------|----------------| 
| Relational Modeling  | Users, Reports, and Locations linked via foreign keys | 
| DDL & DML            | SQL-based table creation, update, insert, delete | 
| Normalization        | All tables follow **2NF structure** |         
| Joins                | Used in admin dashboard and user report views | 
| Constraints          | Primary/Foreign Keys ensure relational integrity | 
| Filtering & Grouping | Used to highlight most-reported locations | 
| Security             | Passwords hashed; NID stored privately |
